# cyk-earley
This is a university lab work for my Formal Grammar and Parsing course.

I implemented the CYK and Earley algorithms for parsing context-free grammars. 

The task consisted in filling in a canvas provided by the teacher so that the program was able to create context-free grammars, correctly parse words according to those and print out the derivation tree if the analysis was successful.

I submitted this work in December 2021.
